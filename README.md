Every Programmer Should Know 🤔
A collection of (mostly) technical things every software developer should know.

☝️ These are resources I can recommend to every programmer regardless of their skill level or tech stack

Highly opinionated 💣. Not backed by science.
Comes in no particular order ♻️

U like it? ⭐️ it and share with a friendly developer! U don't like it? Watch the doggo 🐶

P.S. You don't need to know all of that by heart to be a programmer.
But knowing the stuff will help you become better! 💪
